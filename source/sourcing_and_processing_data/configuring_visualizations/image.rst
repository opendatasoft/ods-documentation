Configuring the image gallery
=============================

.. note::

   The images view is only available when there is at least a *file* field, and
   if at least one file contained in this field is an image, or a document that
   can generate a thumbnail.


Setting up the tooltip
----------------------

In the image gallery view, a click on a image will bring forward a tooltip containing more information about the image.

.. image:: image__tooltip--en.jpg
        :alt: Image Tooltip

You can :doc:`configure the tooltip</sourcing_and_processing_data/configuring_visualizations/tooltip>` in exactly the same way than for the map or the calendar.
