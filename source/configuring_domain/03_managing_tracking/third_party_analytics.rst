Third-party Analytics
=====================

The monitoring tools included in Opendatasoft are centered about API calls and usages; this is useful to gather extremely precise information about how
your data is consumed, but can be limiting if you try to measure the audience of your portal in a more broad manner, such as your referral sources,
your visitor's geographical origin, or the time spent on your portal.

Some third-party services are specialized in measuring audience, and can give this kind of information. Opendatasoft supports integrations with **Google Analytics**
and **XiTi**.

If you need support for another analytics solution that is not mentioned here (such as Piwik or SmartTag), please contact us.


Google Analytics
----------------
