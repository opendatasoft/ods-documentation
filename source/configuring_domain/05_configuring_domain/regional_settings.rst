The time of the events reported in notification emails (reports and alerts) is based on the domain timezone. By default, the timezone of all Opendatasoft domains is UTC.

To change the timezone of a domain, go to Configuration > Regional settings. In this subsection of the back office is displayed the Domain timezone configuration.

1. Click on the Timezone drop-down menu.
2. Choose the right timezone.
3. Click on the Save button in the top right corner of the page.

   It is also possible to directly write a city or zone in the textbox. A selection of matching existing timezones will appear.


CSV delimiter
-------------

The preferred delimiter for CSV files can be either a comma or a semicolon, usually depending on the geographical location. The CSV delimiter configuration allows to define what delimiter will be used by default for CSV exports of datasets.

   :class: note

   This configuration does not apply to the API, which has its own way of choosing the delimiter for CSV exports (see API Search v1 and `API Search v2 <https://help.opendatasoft.com/apis/ods-search-v2/#exporting-datasets>`_).

To define the default CSV delimiter for CSV exports, go to Configuration > Regional settings. In the subsection of the back office is displayed the CSV delimiter configuration.

1. Click on the Delimiter drop-down menu.
2. Choose either "Comma (,)" or "Semicolon (;)".
3. Click on the Save button in the top right corner of the page.
