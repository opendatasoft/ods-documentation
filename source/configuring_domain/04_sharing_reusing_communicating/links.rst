Improving user sharing
======================

Integrating social medias
-------------------------

**Share on social medias buttons**

You can choose to display share buttons that will provide users with quick access to their favorite social networks (Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn and email).

You can enable these share buttons in the ``Social networks & sharing`` section, in the ``Configuration`` menu

**Twitter cards**

If a user tweets a link to a dataset on your portal, a summary can be displayed (the title and description of your dataset), associated with a Twitter account of your choice.

This is a feature provided by Twitter itself. It should work by default without additional configuration, except if your domain is not **whitelisted for summary card** by twitter.

You can check this by previewing a summary on the `Twitter Card page <https://cards-dev.twitter.com/validator>`_. Simply put the URL of one of your public dataset in the Card URL field on this page.

If after clicking on *Preview*, your domain does not appear as **whitelisted for summary card**, you have to request approvals, by clicking on the *Request Approval* button. You also have to input your ``Twitter handle`` to associate your portal with these approved Twitter Cards, in the ``Social networks & sharing`` in the ``Configuration`` menu.

Dataset information cards
-------------------------

When embedding visualizations, users have the option to display an additional information card on top of the embed.

In the ``Embeds`` section in the ``Configuration`` menu, you can configure the position of this information card (top or bottom).

You can also force the display of the information card on every embed using the checkbox *Force embeds to have a dataset information card displayed at all times*
