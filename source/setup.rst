.. admonition:: Note
   :class: note

   The address of an Opendatasoft domain generally looks like one of the following examples:

   - `https://mydomain.opendatasoft.com`
   - `https://mydomain.my.opendatasoft.com`, for personals
   - `https://mydomain.trial.opendatasoft.com`, for free trials

   However, it could also not contain any mention of Opendatasoft if an alias was created for the domain.

Using Opendatasoft as an authenticated user
-------------------------------------------

Once logged in as an Opendatasoft user, you can navigate the front office of the domain (end-user interface) to :doc:`explore the catalog and datasets </exploring_catalog_and_datasets/index>` and even go further by  :doc:`creating maps and charts </creating_maps_charts/index>`. If you were also granted the right permissions, you can access the back office (administration interface) where it is possible to :doc:`publish data </publishing_data/index>`, :doc:`create content </creating_content/index>`, and :doc:`manage </managing_domain/index>` and :doc:`configure the domain </configuring_domain/index>`.

Depending on the domain, there are 2 ways to have an Opendatasoft account:

- it may be possible to create a new account by clicking the "Signup" button that should be displayed in the top right corner (however, not all Opendatasoft domains allow users to signup),
- or, one can be invited to an Opendatasoft domain by an administrator of that domain ; the new user then receives an email with a link to create a new account.

Discovering a domain without having an Opendatasoft account
-----------------------------------------------------------

If you do not have an Opendatasoft account, and that the Opendatasoft domain you want to access is open to unauthenticated users, you are not required to create an account. As a user without an account (also called an anonymous user), it is possible to navigate the front office. However, you will not have access to the back office.
