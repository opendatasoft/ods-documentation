Create a multiple layers map
============================

Add a dataset to your map
-------------------------

1. In the layer editing area, click on **Add a dataset to this map**.
2. Choose the dataset you want to display on your map. You can select a dataset with geographical information either from your own catalog of datasets published on your domain or from the **All available data** catalog.
3. Click on **Select** if you want to add all data or **Filter data** if you just want to add part of the data.

.. admonition:: Note
   :class: note

   You can change dataset or change which part is filtered at any time. To do so, simply click on **Change filter** next to the layerâ€™s title.

You can add as many datasets as you want on your map, and all of the data they contain can be displayed on that same map at the same time. This is when the whole concept of layers comes into play. In Map Builder, because you overlay several datasets, each dataset is called a layer. This is why Map Builder allows you to configure your layers to make sure that you can represent many different data on the same map and still make the reading of this map easy and clear.

.. admonition:: Note
   :class: note

   Keep in mind that the more datasets you add to your map, the heavier it will be and the longer it will take to load.

Edit a layer
------------

The edition of a layer (meaning, a dataset displayed on a map created with Map Builder) has 2 aspects:

* **Display**: the style, in other words, how the data is displayed on the map
* **Information**: the information and caption that go with the dataset to describe it better

Edit style
^^^^^^^^^^

1. Click on the **Display** tab. The menu with all style configurations drops down.
2. Choose a visualization mode and configure your layer as you like.

The style configurations entirely depend on the visualization mode you choose to apply to your layer. There are 5 different modes:

.. localizedimage:: images/viz-modes.png
    :alt: Visualization modes interface

.. admonition:: Note
   :class: note

   The style configurations displayed for each visualization mode also depend on your dataset. Depending on the dataset you added to your Map Builder map, you may not see all the configurations explained in this documentation.

Dots and shapes
"""""""""""""""

The Dots and shapes visualization mode simply displays your data as markers (dots or icons) or as shapes. It is the most common visualization mode.
