* a **Display search box** checkbox, to have the possibility to make research on your map
* a **Display full screen in view mode** checkbox, to display |icon-fullscreen| on your map and thus have the possibility to display your map in full screen
* a **Geolocation** checkbox, to display |icon-localize| on your map and thus have the possibility to focus the map on where you’re located
* an **Auto-geolocation** checkbox, for the map to automatically focus on where you’re located
* a **Display layers and groups visibility control** checkbox, to have the possibility to play with layers and groups of layers (hide them or display them) on the map
