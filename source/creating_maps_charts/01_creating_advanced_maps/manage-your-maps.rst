Manage your maps

Overview of the maps management interface: My Maps
--------------------------------------------------

All maps management actions (except saving and renaming, see :doc:`Rename and save a map <rename-and-save-a-map>`) are made from the **My Maps** interface. This interface is accessible from the Map Builder menu displayed at the very top of the map.

The interface of **My Maps** is composed of:

* the **New map** button, to create a new map
* 2 submenus:

  * **Saved maps**, a list of your named and manually saved maps
  * **Drafts**, a list of your unnamed and automatically saved by Map Builder maps

* a search bar to find a map more easily in case you have quite a long list of maps

The **Saved maps** and **Drafts** submenus display information the same way. In each row of each tab, you will find:

* **Open map**, a link to open the selected map in the same tab
* information on the map, such as title, URL, and number of datasets
* reading and writing rights on the map
* **Duplicate**, a button to duplicate the map
* |icon-trash| to delete the map
