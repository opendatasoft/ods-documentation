Share your map
==============

Overview of the Share interface
-------------------------------

You can share your map thanks to links and HTML codes related to your map, all available in the **Share** interface. This interface is accessible from the Map Builder menu displayed at the very top of the map.

The interface of **Share** is composed of 3 separate sections:

* **Direct link**, a simple direct URL to your map, through the Map Builder of your domain. You could for instance use a direct link to send your Map Builder map by email.
* **Embed map**, to embed your map as an iframe, for example in a blog post.
* **Use map as a widget**, to embed your map as a widget, for example within a page of your Opendatasoft portal or using our Opendatasoft Widgets library.
