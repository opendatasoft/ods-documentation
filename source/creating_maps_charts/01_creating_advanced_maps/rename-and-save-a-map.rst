   Map Builder automatically saves the map you are working on as a draft. It avoids the loss of everything you have been working on for instance if the tab in your browser unfortunately closes or if anything else happens. All your drafts are listed in the **My Maps** interface (accessible from the Map Builder menu), in the **Drafts** tab.

To save a map while working on it or after you’re done, simply click on the **Save** button in the second row of the Map Builder menu. The list of all your saved maps is in the **Saved maps** tab of the **My Maps** interface (accessible from the Map Builder menu).
