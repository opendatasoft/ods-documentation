Content pages: ideas, tips & resources
======================================

Opendatasoft pages allow the creation and integration of a variety of content. Although page templates are available for use, which makes the process of creating a new page content not only easier but also faster (see :ref:`Using page templates<using_page_templates>`), it definitely is a possibility to create a content page from scratch. There are indeed various possible integrations that can be done, and Opendatasoft also offers many resources that can be used as guidelines.

This documentation aims at listing ideas and pieces of advice concerning content pages, as well as links to other useful Opendatasoft resources.


Content integrations
--------------------

The main integration to think of when creating a content page is that of widgets. Opendatasoft widgets are components, available as HTML elements, that can be combined together to build interactive content pages. All widgets are documented in the `Opendatasoft Widgets documentation <https://help.opendatasoft.com/widgets/#/api/>`_.

Some of the best known widgets, and most useful when creating a content page, are the visualization ones. Each Opendatasoft dataset is indeed available through several visualizations, that can all be embedded in a content page (see :doc:`Sharing & embedding data visualizations </exploring_catalog_and_datasets/04_getting_involved/sharing_embedding_data_visualizations>`).

   A few widgets are available in the User Guide instead of the Widgets documentation, because contrary to all other widgets, they cannot be used outside the Opendatasoft environment. See :doc:`Contact form <../tutorials/contact_form/contact_form>` and :doc:`Pages list <../tutorials/pages_list/pages_list>`.

Third-party content (meaning, integrations with elements that are not of the Opendatasoft environment) can also be integrated in a content page, as long as they are available as a pastable HTML piece of code.

   :class: important

   Due to security concerns, JavaScript is not allowed in Opendatasoft pages. Other-party embeds in JavaScript are therefore not supported.

Content creation resources
--------------------------

The user guide is not meant to provide more information about content pages than what is already documented in this Creating content section. There are however other Opendatasoft resources entirely about the content pages topic.

- `Product Concepts <https://discovery.opendatasoft.com/pages/home/?refine.type=Product%20Concept>`_: explained demonstrations of concepts that can be used in content pages, such as HTML, CSS, Angular etc.
- `ODS Templates <https://discovery.opendatasoft.com/pages/home/?refine.type=Template>`_: content page templates that can be copied and are ready to be pasted in an empty page.
- `Tutorials <https://help.opendatasoft.com/tutorials/en/tutorials.html>`_: step by step guides to create entire or parts of content pages, ranked by 3 difficulty levels.
