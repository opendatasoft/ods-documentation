Searching in the data
=====================

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * * Search for records
     * Query
     * Example (based on ods-api-monitoring dataset)
   * * containing a value
     * value
     * ``explore``

       returns every record containing the string explore
   * * containing a value in a specific field
     * id_field:value
     * ``action:explore``

       returns every record containing the string explore in the column named action
   * * containing several values
     * value1 AND value2
     * ``explore AND search``

       returns every record containing both explore and search
   * * containing at least one of the values
     * value1 OR value2
     * ``action OR explore``

       returns every record containing either explore or search
   * * not containing a value
     * NOT value
     * ``NOT anonymous``

       returns every record which does not contain the string anonymous
   * * containing an exact value in a field
     * #exact(id_field,"value")
     * ``#exact(user_id,"anonymous")``

       returns every record containing the exact string anonymous in the column named user_id
   * * if a field is empty
     * #null(id_field)
     * ``#null(referer)``

       returns every record which has no value in the column named referer
   * * where a date's field is anterior to a value
     * id_date_field<=YYYY/MM/DD
     * ``timestamp<=2016/09``

       returns every record with a timestamp prior and equal to September 2016
   * * where a date's field is the current date minus a period
     * id_date_field>#now(days=-value)
     * ``timestamp>#now(days=-7)``

       returns every record with a timestamp equal to the current day minus 7 days
   * * containing a geo field located in a specific area
     * for a circular area:

       #distance("latitude,longitude",distance)

       for a polygon or square area:

       #polygon(geo_field,"(lat1,lon1),(lat2,lon2),(lat3,lon3)")
     * ``#distance("48.866667,2.333333",1000)``

       returns every record located at 1 km from the center of Paris

       ``#polygon(coordinates,"(40.17887331434696,-7.3828125),(52.05249047600099,-7.3828125),(52.05249047600099,16.171875),(40.17887331434696,16.171875),(40.17887331434696,-7.3828125)")``

       returns every record located into the polygon

Query Language and Geo Filtering
--------------------------------

Query language
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Opendatasoft query language makes it possible to express complex boolean conditions as a filtering context.

Full-text search
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The query language accepts full-text queries.

If a given word or compound is surrounded with double quotes, only exact matches are returned (modulo an accent and
case insensitive match).

* ``film`` returns results that contain film, films, filmography...
* ``"film"`` only returns the ones containing exactly film.

Boolean expressions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The query language supports the following Boolean operators ``AND``, ``OR``, and ``NOT``.

Parenthesis can be used to group together expressions and alter the default priority model:

* ``NOT``
* ``AND``
* ``OR``

Samples

* ``film OR trees``
* ``(film OR trees) AND paris``

Field queries
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

One of the major features of the query language is to allow per field filtering. You can use field names as a prefix to
your queries to filter the results based on a specific field's value.

**For dataset search in the catalog**, the list of available fields corresponds exactly to available metadata. By default:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * * Field Name
     * Description
   * * publisher
     * The dataset publisher
   * * title
     * The dataset title
   * * description
     * The dataset description
   * * license
     * The dataset license
   * * records_count
     * The number of records in the dataset
   * * modified
     * The last modification date of the dataset
   * * language
     * The language of the dataset (iso code)
   * * theme
     * The theme of the dataset
   * * references
     * The references for the dataset

The domain administrator might define a richer metadata template, thus giving access to a richer set of filtering fields.

**For record search in a dataset**, the list of available fields depends on the schema of the dataset. To fetch the list of
available fields for a given dataset, you may use the search dataset or lookup dataset APIs.

Multiple operator fields can be used between the field name and the query:

* ``:``, ``=``, ``==``: Return results whose field exactly matches the given value (granted the fields are of text or numeric
  type)
* ``>``, ``<``, ``>=``, ``<=``: Return results whose field values are larger, smaller, larger or equal, smaller or equal to the given value (granted the field is of date or numeric type).
* ``[start_date TO end_date]``: Queries Records whose date is between ``start_date`` and ``end_date``.

Date formats can be specified in different formats: simple (``YYYY[[/mm]/dd]``) or ISO 8601 (``YYYY-mm-DDTHH:MM:SS``)

Examples:

* ``film_date >= 2002``
* ``film_date >= 2013/02/11``
* ``film_date: [1950 TO 2000]``
* ``film_box_office > 10000 AND film_date < 1965``


Query language functions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Advanced functions can be used in the query language. Function names need to be prefixed with a sharp (``#``) sign.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * * Function name
     * Description
   * * now
     * Returns the current date. This function may be called as a query value for a field. When called without an
       argument, it will evaluate to the current datetime: ``birthdate >= #now()`` returns all Records
       containing a birth date greater or equal to the current datetime. This function can also accept parameters. See
       below for the ``#now`` function available parameters.
   * * null
     * This function may be called specifying a field name as a parameter. It returns the hits for which no value is
       defined for the specified field. For example ``#null(birthdate)``
   * * exact
     * This function makes it possible to search for records with a field exactly matching a given value. For example,
       ``#exact(firstname, "Marie")`` will return records with a field ``firstname`` containing exactly "Marie" and
       nothing else.
   * * attr
     * This function makes it possible to search for records with a field matching a value in the querying user's SAML
       attributes. For example, ``#attr(firstname, user_first_name)``, performed by a user who has a SAML attribute
       ``user_first_name`` with a value of "Marie", will return records with a field ``firstname`` containing "Marie".

**Available parameters for the ``#now`` function**:

* years, months, weeks, days, hours, minutes, seconds, microseconds: These parameters add time to the current date.

  For example, ``#now(years=-1, hours=-1)`` returns the current date minus a year and an hour.

* year, month, day, hour, minute, second, microsecond: can also be used to specify an absolute date.

  For example, ``#now(year=2001)`` returns the current time, day, and month for the year 2001.

* weekday: Specifies a day of the week. This parameter accepts either an integer between 0 and 6 (where 0 is Monday and
  6 is Sunday) or the first two letters of the day (in English) followed by the cardinal of the first week on which to
  start the query.

  ``#now(weeks=-2, weekday=1)`` returns the Tuesday before last.

  ``#now(weekday=MO(2))`` returns Monday after next.

Geo Filtering
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Records search accept geofilter parameters to filter in records that are located in a specific geographical area.

The following parameters may be used.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * * Parameter Name
     * Description
   * * geofilter.distance
     * Limits the result set to a geographical area defined by a circle (coordinates of the center of the circle
       expressed in WGS84 and distance expressed in meters): latitude,longitude,distance:
       ``geofilter.distance=48.8520930694,2.34738897685,1000``

       .. admonition:: Note
          :class: note

          This query parameter is equivalent to the ``#distance`` function described at the beginning of this documentation.

   * * geofilter.polygon
     * Limits the result set to a geographical area defined by a polygon (coordinates of the points expressed in WGS84
       as in (lat1,lon1),(lat2,lon2),(lat3,lon3):
       ``geofilter.polygon=(48.883086,2.379072),(48.879022,2.379930),(48.883651,2.386968)``
