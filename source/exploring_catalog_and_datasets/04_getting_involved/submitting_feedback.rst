   Since feedbacks are an optional feature, they are not activated on every OpenDataSoft portal. The activation of feedbacks depends entirely on the portal administrators.

Feedbacks are suggestions of improvement that users can send to portal administrators, through the Table visualization tab of a published dataset. The feedbacks can either be on an existing record, or to request the addition of a new record in the dataset.
