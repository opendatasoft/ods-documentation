   This feature has been deprecated and portal administrators can not activate it anymore. It will be discontinued by **April 28, 2023**.

   Since feedback is an optional feature, it is not activated on every Opendatasoft portal. The activation of the feedback feature depends entirely on the portal administrators.

A feedback is a suggestion of improvement that users can send to portal administrators, through the Table visualization tab of a published dataset. A feedback can either be on an existing record, or to request the addition of a new record in the dataset.
