   Since Disqus is an optional feature, it is not activated on every OpenDataSoft portal. The activation of Disqus depends entirely on the portal administrators.

Disqus is a service that can be integrated into an OpenDataSoft portal. It allows users to post comments in order to share ideas, opinions or to ask questions about a dataset. It is also possible to answer another user's comment.

To comment on a dataset, or reply to someone's comment:

1. Go to the Comments tab of the chosen dataset.
2. (optional) If you are not authenticated on Disqus yet, choose an authentication option (through Disqus, Facebook, Google etc. or by creating a whole new Disqus account).
3. Either write a message in the "Start a discussion" texbox, or click on "Reply" under an existing comment to "Join the discussion".
4. Once the comment is fully written, click on the "Post as [Username]" button below the comment textbox.
