Introduction
============

.. important::

   A new version of APIv2 will be available before the end of May. Major breaking changes will occur, which means that action will be needed on your side if you use it. Please contact us if you need additional information.


.. note::

   If you are already familiar with the structure of the data within the platform and are a seasoned developer or data
   scientist, you may want to dive right in and checkout the `API console <https://data.opendatasoft.com/api/v2/console>`_
   and/or the `API Swagger definition <https://data.opendatasoft.com/api/v2/swagger.json>`_.

   Both these links point to OpenDataSoft's central repository of open data but if you have a portal, you can access
   the same page at ``http://<youropendatasoftportal>/api/``.

In the following section, we'll assume that you know what HTTP verbs (``GET``, ``POST``, ``PUT``...) are and that you
are familiar with HTTP-related vocabulary such as *call*, *request*, *response* *body payload*, *query parameters* etc.
If you are not then please refer to the :doc:`glossary </platform_glossary>` whenever you find a term you do not understand.


OpenDataSoft's API V2 is a full-REST, HATEOAS-enabled, JSON-first API designed to provide access in a coherent,
hierarchical way to all the data available through the platform.

This means that:

- all API endpoints will return JSON data unless required otherwise,
- endpoints are organized in a hierarchical way describing the relative relationship between objects,
- all responses will contain a list of links allowing easy and relevant navigation through the API endpoints.

**Example 1:**

Request:

``GET /api/v2/catalog/datasets``

Response:

A collection of datasets (below, the ``...`` stand for ellipsis).
