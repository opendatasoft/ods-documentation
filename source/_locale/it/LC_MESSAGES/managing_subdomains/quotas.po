"A subdomain's consumption (API calls, number of datasets...) is done "
"directly from the parent domain's quotas. To prevent one of your subdomain "
"to consume too much of your own quotas, you can assign individual limits to "
"each subdomain."

"This will not *assign* a part of your quota for the subdomain's exclusive "
"usage, but will instead act as a limit. So if you have a quota of 1 million "
"API calls per month, and have 5 subdomains each with 500 000 API calls per "
"month, all the quota of your own domain could be consumed entirely by "
"subdomains, but it may also be a good solution if you just want to plan "
"ahead for a sudden API calls surge on your subdomains. Plan carefully!"
