"HTML and CSS are the languages behind every web page; you can do very "
"advanced things with it, but at their core, they are designed to be "
"expressive and easy to learn. After playing with it a bit, you usually can "
"do simple things like changing the layout of your page, changing the size of"
" your text..."

"In this article, we'll walk you through a few basic changes to a standard "
"page template. We do not aim to teach HTML and CSS, as other resources will "
"do this much better than us; however, these are examples that you can start "

"First, let's create a new page based on the \"Main block + right column\" "
"template, as seen in the :doc:`Creating a simple content page "
"</editing_pages/create>` article. Then, switch to **expert mode** using the "
"link in the top right of the interface. You now have two \"CSS\" and "
"\"HTML\" tabs, containing the code behing the page."

"``<div class=\"container-fluid\">`` is the block around the entire page, "

"``<div class=\"row\">`` represents a row, which in turns contains other "

" one is larger than the others."

"``<div class=\"col-md-8\">`` and ``<div class=\"col-md-4\">`` are two blocks"
" containing the \"real\" content (text for example). The idea with the "
"classes ``col-md-8`` and ``col-md-4`` is to think of the available space in "
"each row as a grid of 12 \"cells\"; your blocks inside this row can take a "
"total amount of 12 cells, and each blocks uses ``col-md-X`` where X is the "
"amount of cells it will take. So, here we wanted one blocks taking two "
"thirds of the space, and another block taking one third, so we used 8 and 4 "
"to divide the available 12 cells. All this logic (named \"grid\" logic) is "
"detailed in the :doc:`Designing a responsive portal "
"</customizing_look_and_feel/responsive>` article."

"``<div class=\"ods-box\">`` just creates a visual block with a border and a "

"Now we want to add a new line of three blocks, each taking a third of the "
"space. Following our previous logic, we add a new row, and three blocks "
"taking each 4 cells."

"There are multiple ways to apply CSS \"rules\" to an element of your page, "
"but a good practice to keep in mind is to always use \"classes\": by adding "
"`class=\"myclass\"` to an element in your page, you attach a \"class\" to "
"your element, and then you can write rules for that class in your CSS style."
" This way, you can apply the same class to various elements, and if you "
"change your page, the rules will still apply to your element."
