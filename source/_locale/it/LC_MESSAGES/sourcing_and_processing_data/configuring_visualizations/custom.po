"Standard views allow your users to dive further into your datasets, but they"
" are tools. They do not provide additional context and do not highlight what"
" you think are the key facts to take away. And while the *description* "
"metadata adds a bit of context, it is limited to pure text."

"The custom view is an additional tab that lives alongside the other tabs on "
"the dataset's page. It is an empty space that you can use as you wish. An "
"HTML and CSS editor enables you to write a dashboard as simple or as complex"
" as you may want (for more information about writing beautiful dashboard, "
"see the :doc:`dedicated documentation </editing_pages/index>`) and you can "
"even customize the title and icon of this additional tab."

"Icons are taken from the `Font awesome 4.7 icon set "
"<http://fontawesome.io/icons/>`_ and must be specified through their name "
"(omitting the ``fa-`` prefix). For example, to use the `bar chart "
"<http://fontawesome.io/icon/bar-chart/>`_ icon, whose name is ``fa-bar-"
"chart``, you should input ``bar-chart`` in the icon field. You can also "
"leave this field empty, in which case it will default to the `tachometer "
"icon <http://fontawesome.io/icon/tachometer/>`_."

"In order to illustrate the different possibilities, we'll use a dataset "

"We can of course copy/paste this code into the custom view's HTML code "
"editor and it will give us the requested treemap. However, since we're "
"creating an independant dataset context (named `registreparcprodrpt` in this"
