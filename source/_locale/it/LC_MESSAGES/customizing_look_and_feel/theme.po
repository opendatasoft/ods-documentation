"This is to say that your work has a version number assigned to it and you "
"can at any moment create a new version. You'll always be working on the "
"latest version (think of it as your working draft), but can make any version"
" live (that is, apply it to your portal). Were you to make the latest "

"Both header and footer are wrapped within independent AngularJS "
