"When a domain is created it has one URL, in the form "
"``<domain>.opendatasoft.com``. As the domain URL is a very important tool "
"for discoverability, branding and ease of access, there will often be a need"
" to customize this URL. As such, the OpenDataSoft platform allows for adding"
" URLs to a domain. These customization options are currently not exposed in "
"the back office, and must be requested by using the support form in the back"
" office. The customization options are detailed below."

"It is possible to add an additional opendatasoft URL that will be used to "
"access the domain. It is in the form ``<alias>.opendatasoft.com``, where "
"``alias`` is a word composed of lowercase alphanumeric characters and "
"hyphens."

msgid ""
"It is also possible to link your OpenDataSoft domain to a custom subdomain "
"whose authoritative DNS server you control. For instance a company called "
"\"Example\" might want to set up their domain in order to have "
"``data.example.com`` directing to it. This can be done in two steps: first "
"create a DNS record of the ``CNAME`` type for your subdomain with the "
"default URL as a value. ``A`` or ``AAAA`` types records are not supported by"
" the platform as the IP address of your domain is susceptible to change. "
"Then, the URL corresponding to the subdomain must be registered as an alias."
" To do so, please contact the OpenDataSoft support by using the support form"
" in the back office."

"HTTPS is a widely used protocol which aims at insuring privacy and integrity"
" of the exchanges between a website and its users by providing HTTP over a "
"secure communication layer. For these safety and integrity reasons, the "
"OpenDataSoft platform enforces the use of HTTPS throughout its services, and"
" as such, requests made to OpenDataSoft URLs and custom subdomains are HTTPS"
" enabled. If you opted to add an OpenDataSoft URL, the SSL configuration is "
"the same as with the default URL. However, if you chose to use a custom "
"subdomain, the SSL will be handled through `Let's Encrypt "
"<https://letsencrypt.org/>`_."

msgid ""
"If you have multiple languages on your domain and use language-specific "
"subdomains, you can request that the subdomains force languages for users "
"that access the domain through them. For instance, if you have two "
"subdomains ``data.example.co.uk`` and ``daten.example.de``, you can request "
"that users accessing the domain through the former be served english "
"content, and those accessing it through the latter be served german content."
