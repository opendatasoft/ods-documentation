"You can manage access, visibility on data and edition permissions on a per "

"In this case, you can apply general filters for all people that access your "
"dataset (see below for filter configuration). That filters will apply to all"

"You have three different options available that you can combine. First you "

"visible`. If you uncheck this input, the user will only be able to access "
"the information (metadata) part of the dataset, including the list of "
"fields. If you restrict the visibility of the data, you should explain to "
"your user how they can access the data, either by contacting the domain "
"administrators or going to an external billing system or any other case you "
"can think about."
