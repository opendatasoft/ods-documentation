"Like many websites, OpenDataSoft's portal uses a grid layout to position "

"A grid layout relies on 3 types of elements: containers, rows and columns. "
"Containers define the overall width of the layout, rows group together cells"

"In webdesign, *responsive layout* means that the layout will adapt to the "
"width of the screen it is displayed on. To be even more precise, it responds"
" to the width of the viewport of the device, that is the space available for"

"Responsive layouts work by defining *breakpoints*, widths in pixels marking "
"levels at which the layout will change. Within the OpenDataSoft's platform, "
"3 breakpoints (defining 4 modes) are defined and can be :ref:`customized "
"through the theme <theme__layout-options>`. These modes are *extra-small*, "
"*small*, *medium* and *large* (also refered to as *mobile*, *tablet*, "
"*desktop* and *large desktop*)."

"A grid layout is designed for a given window width but can quite quickly "
"become unsuited for other screen formats. For example, a very detailed 12 "
"columns layout will render terribly on a tiny screen, all content being "
"crammed into tiny cells each taking one-twelfth of the little space "
"available. We'd like instead to have the layout reorganize itself when it "

"You may have noticed in the code snippets above that the class names for the"

" before the number of columns the cell should span. This tells the browser "
"that in *extra-small* mode, the cell should span 6 of the 12 super-tiny "
"columns. We can however add classes specifying how we'd like the layout to "
"behave in other modes. For example:"
msgstr ""

"You don't have to specify all 4 levels though. The classes default to a "

"specified column-span for larger display modes. ``<div class=\"col-"

"sm-12 col-md-4 col-lg-4\"></div>`` and ``<div class=\"col-sm-6 col-"
