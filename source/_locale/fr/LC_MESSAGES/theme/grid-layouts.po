"Like many websites, OpenDataSoft's portal uses a grid layout to position "
"elements. A grid is the intersection of rows and columns of pre-defined "
"width, which will be used to position elements within a layout. This very "
"common design tool as been adapted to webdesign first using tables and soon "
"thereafter using standard ``div`` elements."

"If you are already familiar with the whole concept of grid layouts, suffice-"
"it to say that OpenDataSoft's grid system is largely based on `Bootstrap CSS"
" framework <http://getbootstrap.com/css/#grid>`_. You can see the list of "
"`Available classes`_ below."

"OpenDataSoft grid layout is a 12-column layout, which means that grid cells "
"can span 1 to 12 columns at once."

"A grid layout relies on 3 types of elements: containers, rows and columns. "
"Containers define the overall width of the layout, rows group together cells"
" and columns are one-twelfth of the container's width. As a result, cells "
"are defined by the number of columns they span and are nested within rows, "
"which themselves are nested within containers."

"You can of course specify cells covering less than 12 columns, in which case"

"In webdesign, *responsive layout* means that the layout will adapt to the "
"width of the screen it is displayed on. To be even more precise, it responds"
" to the width of the viewport of the device, that is the space available for"
" rendering, that is the width of the browser's window."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/theme/grid-layouts.rst:89
msgid ""
"Responsive layouts work by defining *breakpoints*, widths in pixels marking "
"levels at which the layout will change. Within the OpenDataSoft's platform, "
"3 breakpoints (defining 4 modes) are defined and can be :ref:`customized "
"through the theme <theme__layout-options>`. These modes are *extra-small*, "
"*small*, *medium* and *large* (also refered to as *mobile*, *tablet*, "
"*desktop* and *large desktop*)."

"A grid layout is designed for a given window width but can quite quickly "
"become unsuited for other screen formats. For example, a very detailed 12 "
"columns layout will render terribly on a tiny screen, all content being "
"crammed into tiny cells each taking one-twelfth of the little space "
"available. We'd like instead to have the layout reorganize itself when it "
"changes mode."

"You may have noticed in the code snippets above that the class names for the"
" cells ``<div class=\"col-xs-6\">col-6</div>`` include a little ``xs`` right"
" before the number of columns the cell should span. This tells the browser "
"that in *extra-small* mode, the cell should span 6 of the 12 super-tiny "
"columns. We can however add classes specifying how we'd like the layout to "
"behave in other modes. For example:"

"This way the cell will span 6 columns in extra-small mode, 4 in small mode, "
"2 in medium mode and only 1 in large mode."

"You don't have to specify all 4 levels though. The classes default to a "
"standard 12-columns span below there own display mode and keep their "
"specified column-span for larger display modes. ``<div class=\"col-"
"md-4\"></div>`` is therefore equivalent to ``<div class=\"col-xs-12 col-"
"sm-12 col-md-4 col-lg-4\"></div>`` and ``<div class=\"col-sm-6 col-"
"lg-3\"></div>`` is equivalent to ``<div class=\"col-xs-12 col-sm-6 col-md-6 "
"col-lg-3\"></div>``."
