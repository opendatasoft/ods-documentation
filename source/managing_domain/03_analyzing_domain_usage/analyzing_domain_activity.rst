Analyzing domain activity
=========================

Go to the *Analytics > Backoffice* page.

Backoffice Analytics
--------------------

The Backoffice analytics allows the domain administrator to monitor domain configuration activity.

There are seven indicators :

1. **Actions**: Frequency and distribution of actions (analyze, geo, search) taken by users based on API calls. It gives you precious information about what your users do and how to serve them better. Remember that, like with every chart on Opendatasoft, you can filter the variables displayed (Analyze, Geo, or Search) by clicking on the legend labels.
