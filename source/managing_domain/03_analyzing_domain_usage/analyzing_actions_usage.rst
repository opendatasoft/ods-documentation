Analyzing actions usage
=======================

Go to the *Analytics > Actions* page.

There are eight indicators :

1. **Actions**: Frequency and distribution of actions (analyze, geo, search) taken by users based on API calls. Gives you precious information about what your users do and how to better serve them. Also remember that like with every chart on OpenDataSoft you can filter the variables displayed (Analyze, Geo or Search) by clicking on the legend labels.

API calls Errors
----------------

In most cases you won't be able to do anything. Anyway we want to be transparent on your users' usage.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * * Error name
     * Error Description
   * * DatastoreError
     * This is a server error, we monitor it real time on our side to avoid it.
   * * InvalidPolygon
     * The defined polygon filter on a geo-query is malformed. For example it can be a self-crossing polygon like an hourglass.
   * * HTTPError
     * It comes from a federated dataset. It may happen when you change the schema of a dataset when it is already federated on another portal. Always be careful when you update a dataset's schema.
   * * MissingParameters
     * It may happen when you forget the dataset_id in the API console.
   * * UnknownDataset
     * The dataset_id on the URL doesn't exist or someone has tried to access a dataset without having the right.
   * * ResultWindowTooHigh
     * The search API is paginated with an offset and a response size. You can't access more than ~10k results. If you want more than 10k results you'll probably want to use the download API.
