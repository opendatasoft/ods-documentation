Managing access requests
========================

Access requests are generated each time somebody registers on your portal and you've requested manual approval of each signup.

   Unsure about what this means? Check the :doc:`portal security policy section </configuring_domain/01_managing_security/portal>`!

You'll find access requests in your portal's back office, within the **Users & groups** section. If you have pending access requests, their number will show up in a notification right within the menu.

For each pending access request, you'll find the user's details (username, first name and last name) alongside their request message (if any) and the two *approve* and *reject* buttons.

Rejecting an access request will send an email to its author saying so. Approving it on the other hand will send a notification to the user and add him/her to the list of your portal's members. He/she will automatically get the default permissions you've set up for new users.

For more information about users management, check the :doc:`dedicated section </managing_domain/01_managing_users_and_groups/users>`.
