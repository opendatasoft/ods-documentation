Designing a responsive portal
=============================

A responsive portal header
--------------------------

.. important::
   The theme customization is not available on freemium domains (created through the
   `Try it for free <https://www.opendatasoft.com/discover-opendatasoft-demo/>`_ page on
   `Opendatasoft's website <https://www.opendatasoft.com>`_).
   If your domain is a freemium domain and would like to get this theme feature, `email us! <sales@opendatasoft.com>`_

.. warning::

    This page explores in length the customization of the platform responsive menu directive. This entails a fair amount
    of HTML and CSS code to be written and explained. You'll need working knowledge of both these technologies to
    understand the content of this page.

    For basic customization needs, check out :doc:`customizing your portal's theme </customizing_look_and_feel/06_customizing_theme/theme>`.


One very common pattern in graphic design is to have the header menu hidden on small screens and replaced by a single
toggle button, which usually features the famous *hamburger icon* |hamburger|.

.. |hamburger| image:: images/responsive-menus__hamburger.png

Clicking this button opens or closes a drawer containing all menu items. This behaviour can be seen on
`Opendatasoft's central data repository <https://data.opendatasoft.com/page/home/>`_ and on all new portals.

    :align: left

    Closed drawer

    :align: right

    Open drawer

Implementation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Implementing this behaviour usually means resorting heavily to *media queries*, that is CSS rules applied only for a
given screen width. To facilitate this work, Opendatasoft's provides a handy directive called ``ods-responsive-menu``
that you should use within the header as follow.

.. code-block:: html

    <nav class="ods-front-header" ods-responsive-menu breakpoint="1000">
        <ods-responsive-menu-placeholder>
            <!-- content displayed only below the 1000px breakpoint -->
        </ods-responsive-menu-placeholder>
        <ods-responsive-menu-collapsible>
            <!-- content displayed normally above the 1000px breakpoint -->
            <!-- and collapsed within the drawer below the 1000px breakpoint -->
        </ods-responsive-menu-collapsible>
    </nav>

This directive is actually an ensemble of 3 directives:

* ``ods-responsive-menu`` (attribute directive, used as an attribute of another html tag)

  Used to specify (through the ``breakpoint`` attribute) the screen width (in px) under which the drawer should
  appear and over which things should be displayed normally.

* ``ods-responsive-menu-placeholder`` (element directive used as an html tag)

  Wraps the content that will be invisible unless we are below the breakpoint.

* ``ods-responsive-menu-collapsible`` (element directive)

  Wraps the content that will be displayed normally over the breakpoint but collapsed within the drawer below.

Writing styles for the collapsed header content
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Going from an horizontal layout to a vertical layouts entails quite a few graphical changes, as demonstrated by the
platform's default header.

.. figure:: images/responsive-menus__header-desktop.png
    :align: center

    Desktop header.

.. figure:: images/responsive-menus__header-mobile.png
    :align: center

    Mobile header.

In order for you to change the style accordingly, the ``ods-responsive-menu-collapsible`` element will wrap its content
with the ``.ods-responsive-menu-collapsible--collapsed`` when (and only when) the screen is smaller than the breakpoint.
This enables you to clearly separate the style for the two layout-styles (horizontal and vertical).

.. code-block:: css

    .my-menu-class {
        /* horizontal style */
    }
    .ods-responsive-menu-collapsible--collapsed .my-menu-class {
        /* vertical style */
    }


Writing styles for the drawer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you'd like to customize the overall look of the drawer, you will need to know the name of the classes applied to
elements created by the 3 directives. The code sample we saw earlier will render as:

.. code-block:: html

    <nav class="ods-front-header" ods-responsive-menu breakpoint="1000">
        <div class="ods-responsive-menu-placeholder">
            <!-- content displayed only below the 1000px breakpoint -->
        </div>
        <div class="ods-responsive-menu-collapsible">
            <div class="ods-responsive-menu-collapsible__backdrop"></div>
            <div class="ods-responsive-menu-collapsible__container">
                <div class="ods-responsive-menu-collapsible__toggle">
                    <button class="ods-responsive-menu-collapsible__toggle-button">
                        <i class="fa fa-close"></i>
                    </button>
                </div>
                <div class="ods-responsive-menu-collapsible__content">
                    <!-- content displayed normally above the 1000px breakpoint -->
                    <!-- and collapsed within the drawer below the 1000px breakpoint -->
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>
    </nav>

On top of that, the ``.ods-responsive-menu-collapsible`` element will get the class
``.ods-responsive-menu-collapsible--collapsed`` as soon as the screen width falls below the breakpoint and the class
``.ods-responsive-menu-collapsible--expanded`` to mark whenever the user wants the menu to be displayed.

Responsive page layouts
-----------------------

Like many websites, Opendatasoft's portal uses a grid layout to position elements. A grid is the intersection of rows
and columns of pre-defined width, which will be used to position elements within a layout. This very common design tool
as been adapted to webdesign first using tables and soon thereafter using standard ``div`` elements.

If you are already familiar with the whole concept of grid layouts, suffice-it to say that Opendatasoft's grid system
is largely based on `Bootstrap CSS framework <http://getbootstrap.com/css/#grid>`_. You can see the list of
`Available classes`_ below.

Concepts and terminology
------------------------

Opendatasoft grid layout is a 12-column layout, which means that grid cells can span 1 to 12 columns at once.

A grid layout relies on 3 types of elements: containers, rows and columns. Containers define the overall width of the
layout, rows group together cells and columns are one-twelfth of the container's width. As a result, cells are defined
by the number of columns they span and are nested within rows, which themselves are nested within containers.

Translated into html code:

.. code-block:: html

     <div class="container">
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-xs-1">col-1</div>
            <div class="col-xs-1">col-1</div>
            <div class="col-xs-1">col-1</div>
            <div class="col-xs-1">col-1</div>
            <div class="col-xs-1">col-1</div>
            <div class="col-xs-1">col-1</div>
            <div class="col-xs-1">col-1</div>
            <div class="col-xs-1">col-1</div>
            <div class="col-xs-1">col-1</div>
            <div class="col-xs-1">col-1</div>
            <div class="col-xs-1">col-1</div>
            <div class="col-xs-1">col-1</div>
        </div>
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-xs-8">col-8</div>
            <div class="col-xs-1">col-1</div>
            <div class="col-xs-3">col-3</div>
        </div>
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-xs-1">col-1</div>
            <div class="col-xs-2">col-2</div>
            <div class="col-xs-3">col-3</div>
            <div class="col-xs-4">col-4</div>
            <div class="col-xs-2">col-2</div>
        </div>
    </div>

Will render as (colors and labels added via CSS specifically for these examples):

.. image:: images/grid-layouts__concept.png

You can of course specify cells covering less than 12 columns, in which case there will be remaining white space at the
end. In the case they cover more than 12 columns, the cells would wrap and create a new line within the row.

Hence, this:

.. code-block:: html

    <div class="container">
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-xs-4">col-4</div>
            <div class="col-xs-3">col-3</div>
            <div class="col-xs-2">col-2</div>
            <div class="col-xs-1">col-1</div>
        </div>
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-xs-8">col-8</div>
            <div class="col-xs-6">col-6</div>
        </div>
    </div>

Will render as this:

.. image:: images/grid-layouts__overflow.png

Responsive grid layouts
-----------------------

In webdesign, *responsive layout* means that the layout will adapt to the width of the screen it is displayed on. To be
even more precise, it responds to the width of the viewport of the device, that is the space available for rendering,
that is the width of the browser's window.

Responsive layouts work by defining *breakpoints*, widths in pixels marking levels at which the layout will change.
Within the Opendatasoft's platform, 3 breakpoints (defining 4 modes) are defined and can be
:ref:`customized through the theme <layout_options>`. These modes are *extra-small*, *small*, *medium* and
*large* (also refered to as *mobile*, *tablet*, *desktop* and *large desktop*).

A grid layout is designed for a given window width but can quite quickly become unsuited for other screen formats. For
example, a very detailed 12 columns layout will render terribly on a tiny screen, all content being crammed into tiny
cells each taking one-twelfth of the little space available. We'd like instead to have the layout reorganize itself when
it changes mode.

You may have noticed in the code snippets above that the class names for the cells ``<div class="col-xs-6">col-6</div>``
include a little ``xs`` right before the number of columns the cell should span. This tells the browser that in
*extra-small* mode, the cell should span 6 of the 12 super-tiny columns. We can however add classes specifying how we'd
like the layout to behave in other modes. For example:

.. code-block:: html

    <div class="col-xs-6 col-sm-4 col-md-2 col-lg-1">my responsive cell</div>

This way the cell will span 6 columns in extra-small mode, 4 in small mode, 2 in medium mode and only 1 in large mode.

You don't have to specify all 4 levels though. The classes default to a standard 12-columns span below there own
display mode and keep their specified column-span for larger display modes. ``<div class="col-md-4"></div>`` is
therefore equivalent to ``<div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-md-4 col-lg-4"></div>`` and
``<div class="col-sm-6 col-lg-3"></div>`` is equivalent to ``<div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-6 col-md-6 col-lg-3"></div>``.
