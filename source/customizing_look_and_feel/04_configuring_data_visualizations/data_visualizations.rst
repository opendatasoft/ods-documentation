Configuring the data visualizations
===================================

Although the visualizations of the created datasets are configured both in terms of content and appearance from the edition interface of the datasets themselves, some other global data visualizations configurations such as custom default chart colors, available basemaps, and default map locations, are managed from the Look & feel > Data visualizations interface.

Defining a default Map Builder location
---------------------------------------

The Map Builder is Opendatasoft's tool to create advanced maps using one or more published dataset from one or more Opendatasoft portal. The Default map builder location configuration allows to defined which location the Map Builder will focus on by default when landing on it.

1. In the Data visualizations configuration interface, go to the Default map builder location area.
2. Click on the map, and maintain the click while moving the map until the chosen location is is enclosed in the rectangle. Some options are available to help defining the right location:

   - [+] and [-] zoom in and out,
   - [>] moves the map to your current location,
   - [find] allows to make a textual search of a location.

3. Click the Save button in the top right corner of the page.
