Branding the portal
===================

Opendatasoft portals can be customized according to a chosen corporate branding. Go to the **Look & feel > Branding** subsection of the back office to choose a portal name, write a portal description, choose a page title prefix, define the brand name and add a portal favicon or logo.


Choosing a portal name
----------------------
