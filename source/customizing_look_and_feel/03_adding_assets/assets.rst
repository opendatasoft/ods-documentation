Adding assets
=============

Assets are files that are uploaded in an Opendatasoft domain in order to be usable throughout that same domain (for example, in the domain :ref:`stylesheet <stylesheet>`, in :doc:`content pages </creating_content/index>`, etc.). Either images or font files can be added as assets in the domain.

This feature is available in the **Assets** section of the back office of an Opendatasoft domain.

   Metadata is not stripped from uploaded files. The tags may expose sensitive information, such as geolocation data or device information.
   
   Before uploading files, make sure you strip metadata you want to keep private.
