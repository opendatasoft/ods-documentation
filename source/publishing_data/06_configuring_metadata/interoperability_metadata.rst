Interoperability metadata
=========================

Interoperability metadata are activated on demand. They should be configured in the Information tab of the edition interface of a dataset, each type of metadata having their own specific tab. Once the dataset is published, all interoperability metadata will be displayed in the Information tab of the dataset (front office).

There are 3 kinds of interoperability metadata available:

- DCAT
- DCAT-AP for Switzerland
- INSPIRE

   Custom interoperability metadata can be created and activated on demand. Please contact Opendatasoft to know more about custom interoperability metadata.

DCAT metadata
-------------

DCAT metadata aim at facilitating interoperability between data catalogs published on the Web.

For more information about the DCAT metadata, please refer to the `W3C Data Catalog Vocabulary (DCAT) documentation <https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat/>`_. To know how to configure the metadata on the Opendatasoft platform, refer to the table below.

INSPIRE
-------

INSPIRE metadata are defined by the European Commission. They should ensure that metadata are created for specific spatial data sets and services and that those metadata are kept up to date. These metadata particularly focus on datasets with geographic coordinates.

For more information about the INSPIRE metadata, please refer to the `INSPIRE knowledge base <https://inspire.ec.europa.eu/metadata/6541>`_. To know how to configure the metadata on the Opendatasoft platform, refer to the table below.
