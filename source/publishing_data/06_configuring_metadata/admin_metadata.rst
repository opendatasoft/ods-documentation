Admin metadata
==============

Admin metadata are activated on demand, because they are entirely custom. They should be configured in the Information tab of the edition interface of a dataset, in a specific tab displayed under the standard metadata. Admin metadata are not meant to be communicated to users, this is why they are not displayed anywhere in the front office.

   Please contact OpenDataSoft for the creation and activation of admin metadata. We will need the following information to create these metadata:

   * Name of the group of admin metadata (which will be the label of the related tab in the Information tab)
   * Name of each metadata and its type (e.g. text, date, etc.)
