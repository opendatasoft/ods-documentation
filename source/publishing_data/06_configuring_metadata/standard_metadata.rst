Standard metadata
=================

Standard metadata are common to all Opendatasoft portal. They are the default metadata of any dataset. They should be configured in the Information tab of the edition interface of a dataset. Once the dataset is published, the standard metadata will be displayed in the Information tab of the dataset (front office).

Refer to the table below to know more about the available metadata and how to configure them.

.. list-table::
  :header-rows: 1

  * * Name
    * Description
    * Usage
  * * Title
    * Title of the dataset. Only metadata located above the edition tabs of the interface instead of in the Information tab.
    * Write a dataset title in the textbox. All special characters are supported. Modifying the title does not change the technical identifier of the dataset.
  * * Identifier
    * Technical identifier of the dataset.
    * 1. Click the "Modify identifier" button.
      2. Modify the current identifier of the dataset.
      3. Click the "Modify" button for the changes to be taken into account.

      .. admonition:: Warning
         :class: danger

         Changing the technical identifier of a dataset could break third-party applications using it. Embedded visualizations from the dataset also won't work anymore.
         Note also that once the dataset is published, the technical identifier cannot be modified anymore.

  * * Last modification date
    * Date indicating when the dataset was last modified.
    * The date can either be set manually or automatically.

      * To set the date manually, click the "Set to now" button. Click on this button each time the last modification date needs to be updated.
      * To set the date automatically, depending on which action should lead to the modification of the date, tick either or both:

        * the "Update automatically when metadata has changed" box,
        * the "Update automatically when data has changed" box.
  * * Language
    * Language of the data in the dataset.
    * 1. Click on the drop down menu.
      2. Choose a language amongst the Domain languages or other languages available.
  * * Geographic area
    * Geographic area of the data contained in the dataset. This metadata is directly linked to :ref:`the mini map displayed in the front office of the portal <using-the-minimap>` : if the geographic area metadata is set for a dataset, an end-user will be able to find it through a geographic search of the catalog.
    * Tick the box of the chosen option amongst the following:

      * None *(default)*: the geographic area won't be set for the dataset, which won't be searchable through the mini map.
      * Computed from data: the geographic area will be defined as the smallest envelope containing all of the records' locations. Note that all data will be taken into account for this computation regardless of security parameters. The option is only available if the dataset contains geopoints.
      * Manually drawn on a map: a map appears under this option when it is ticked. Draw a shape on the right geographic area corresponding to the data of the dataset.
      * Pasted GeoJSON shape: a textbox appears under this option when it is ticked. Paste the GeoJSON shape of the right geographic area corresponding to the data of the dataset.
  * * Description
    * Description of the dataset.
    * Write a dataset description in the textbox. HTML is accepted. A set of formatting options are available in the grey bar at the top of the textbox: hover the buttons for more information and click on the chosen buttons to use any formatting option.
  * * Themes
    * Theme(s) the dataset belongs to. Dataset themes are one of the catalog filters available in the front office of an Opendatasoft portal.
    * 1. Click on the textbox. A drop down selection of the themes defined for the domain automatically appears.
      2. Click on the chosen theme.
      3. (optional) To add another theme to the dataset, click on the + button on the right of the textbox.

  * * Keywords
    * Keyword(s) to define the dataset and better find it through searches. Keywords are one of the catalog filters available in the front office of an Opendatasoft portal.
    * 1. Write a keyword in the textbox. It can contain special characters and be comprised of one or more words.
      2. (optional) A list of already used keywords appears, matching the letters just written in the textbox. It is possible to click on one of these keywords to reuse them.
      3. Once the keyword is selected or written, press Enter.

  * * License
    * License attached to the dataset.
    * 1. Click on the arrow on the right of the textbox. A drop down selection of the main open data licenses appears.
      2. Click on the chosen license. If the right license is not in the selection, write it in that same textbox.
  * * Timezone
    * Forces the dataset visualizations to use the defined timezone for the date and datetime fields. It avoids the dataset visualizations to depend on the timezone on which the user's computer is set.
    * 1. Click on the arrow on the right of the textbox. A drop down selection of timezones appears.
      2. Click on the chosen timezone.
