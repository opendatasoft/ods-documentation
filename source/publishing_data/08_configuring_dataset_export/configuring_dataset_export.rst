Configuring dataset export
==========================

Users can download datasets from the Export tab of a published dataset in the front office. To configure the content of the Export tab, go to the same-named Export tab of the dataset, but from the back office.

Specifying a sort for downloads
-------------------------------

By default, the records of a dataset download are ordered randomly. It is possible to configure the sorting of the records, by choosing a sort type for a chosen field.

   Only fields that can be sorted by default, or fields that have been set as sortable, can be selected for this feature.

1. Click on the Default sort list box.
2. Choose a field from the dataset, on which to base the sorting. Another list box appears.
3. Choose a sort type from the newly appeared list box.

   The download sort does not apply on additional export formats.
