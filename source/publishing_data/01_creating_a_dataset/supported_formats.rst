Supported compressed file formats
---------------------------------

OpenDataSoft also supports compressed file formats. These are useful to save space, since files added to a dataset can't be more than 240Mo. Compressed file formats can also be used in the platform to create a dataset with multiple files (see :doc:`Creating a dataset with multiple files<creating_dataset_with_multiple_files>`)

* .zip
* .bz2
* .tar
* .gz
* .gzip
* .tar.gr
* .tgz
* .tar.bz2
