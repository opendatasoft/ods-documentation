Creating a dataset
==================

Creating a dataset involves the following steps:

.. rubric:: Step 1: Adding a source

When you create a dataset, you start with adding a source.

You can add a source to a dataset in the following ways:

- :doc:`Retrieving a file from your computer, a URL, or an FTP server<retrieving_file>`
- :doc:`Retrieving an Opendatasoft dataset<retrieving_dataset>`
- :doc:`Configuring a remote service<configuring_remote_service>`


.. rubric:: Step 2. Configuring the connection to the source

To retrieve data from your source, you must establish the connection between this source and the Opendatasoft platform. For FTP, Google Drive, HTTP, and SharePoint, you can configure and save a new connection or reuse a saved connection.

.. rubric:: Step 3: Configuring the source to make sure your data look good

From the preview, you can configure your source.

For more information about the sources you can connect to and their configuration, see :ref:`supportedformats` and :ref:`connectors_remote_services`.

.. rubric:: Step 4: Configuring the dataset standard metadata and access rights

From the **Dataset information** screen, you can configure the dataset title and technical identifier to keep or edit the default values. You can also set up the dataset access rights.

After you create a dataset, you can add a new source, or edit an existing source and its connection using the **Sources** tab of the desired dataset.
