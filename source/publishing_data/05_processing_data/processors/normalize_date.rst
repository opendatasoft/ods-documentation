Normalize date processor
========================

This processor allows to parse a date which format is not automatically understood by the platform.

Example: if a date is in the dd/mm/YYYY format (commonly used format in France ; for instance 09/10/2017 for October 9th 2017), the platform will by default intervert day and month, based on the ISO 8601 ``YYYY-mm-dd`` ideal format (09/10/2017 will then be understood by the platform as September 10th 2017).

With this processor, you can normalize a date to the ISO 8601 format ``YYYY-mm-dd`` using the following syntax: ``%Y-%m-%d``.


Setting the processor
---------------------

To set the parameters of the Normalize date processor, follow the indications from the table below.

.. list-table::
  :header-rows: 1

  * * Label
    * Description
    * Mandatory
  * * Field
    * Field containing the date not understood by the platform
    * yes
  * * Date format
    * Date format pattern of the misunderstood date (see **Date format pattern** indications below to fill this parameter)
    * yes


Date format pattern
-------------------

A pattern is an arbitrary string containing one of the following directives. Use these directives to write, in the Date format parameter, what is the right, current format of the date that the platform did not understand. Thanks to the processor, the platform will follow the indicated pattern to be able to understand the format of the date.
