Translating the Information tab
===============================

When clicking on the Edit link related to the Information tab, a translation window opens. It allows to translate elements specific to the Information tab of the dataset.

The Information tab contains the dataset metadata. Among the existing metadata, only the following can be translated:

- Title
- Description
- Keywords
- Publisher

.. admonition:: Note
   :class: note

   The translation window only enables the translation of the metadata that have already been configured in the original language.

The Information translation window displays:

- On the left side (1), the metadata that can be translated, along with the value in the original language.

  - Untranslated elements are preceded by a grey X icon.
  - Translated elements are preceded by a green X icon.

- On the right side (2), the textboxes where the translations should be written. The textboxes are the same for each metadata as in the Information tab (i.e. the Description metadata textbox allows formatting).
