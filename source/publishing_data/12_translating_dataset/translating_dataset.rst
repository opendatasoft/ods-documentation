Translating a dataset
=====================

For domains with more than one language activated in the front office, OpenDataSoft allows the translation of specific elements of the datasets, as well as their metadata, to help users understand a dataset as best as they can even though the data itself is not in their preferred language.

In the Opendatasoft platform, these translations are done in the Translations tab of the edition interface of each dataset.

On the left side (1) are listed all available languages to which various elements from the dataset can be translated.

On the right side (2) are displayed the names of the 2 tabs which contain elements that can be translated: Information and Processing. Around the latter are also displayed:

- an Edit clickable link, that opens the translation window
- a progress bar, that indicates how much of the elements have already been translated
