Configuring the Analyze visualization
=====================================


.. admonition:: Prerequisite
   :class: important

   For the Analyze visualization to be available, the dataset must contain at least one date or datetime field, or a field set as a facet.


In the edition interface of a dataset, the Visualizations > Analyze tab allows to configure the default chart of the Analyze visualization displayed in the front office, once the dataset is published on the portal.

The Analyze visualization, when available, is optional. It can be enabled or disabled using the tick box displayed right under the visualizations tabs.

Above the chart preview are displayed a variety of buttons and options to configure the default chart of the Analyze visualization:
