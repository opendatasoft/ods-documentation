   API keys are bound to a specific domain. They only work on the domain on which they were created.

These API keys allow you to use the following APIs: ODS Search API v1 and v2, OData, WFS, and CSW (more info in the :doc:`Using APIs </exploring_catalog_and_datasets/04_getting_involved/using_api>` documentation).
