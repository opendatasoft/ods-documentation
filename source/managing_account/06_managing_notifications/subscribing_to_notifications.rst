Subscribing to notifications
============================

Whenever an important event occurs on your portal, notification emails are sent. This gives you the opportunity to be informed in real time and take action if needed.

Notifications are sent by email to your portal's users depending on their permissions. They are always sent by the support@opendatasoft.com address.

   If you'd like notifications to be sent from a different sender address, for example an address of your own organization, please contact the support team.

Each user can manage their subscription to the different notification types on their account page.
