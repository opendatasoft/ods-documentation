Subscribing to alerts and reports
---------------------------------

Alerts and reports notifications are sent whenever an important event occurs on the portal. They give the opportunity to be informed in real time and take action if needed.

3 types of domain-related notifications can be sent:

- Daily reports: portal alerts and news sent daily at 9AM. They notify users about processing alerts, newly created datasets on the portal, and pending user feedbacks on a dataset (:doc:`more information<daily_report>`).
- Processing alerts: sent whenever there is a processing alert on a newly created dataset. They notify about processors in error, and errors of realtime dataset update (:doc:`more information<processing_alert>`).
- Quota alerts: sent when a quota has reached 80% or is expired (:doc:`more information<quota>`).

Tick the box corresponding to any of the Notifications to subscribe. Untick any of the boxes to stop receiving the corresponding notification.
