   Always keep the needs of your audience in mind when choosing the page title, URL, and content.

1. From the left side pane, click **Fill in page details** in the **Page information** section.
2. Enter the general page information in the corresponding fields:

   - **Page title**: the page title appears in the list of pages and is used as the tab title when browsing the page.
   - **URL**: the default URL is pre-filled according to the page title. You can change the URL freely, as long as the page is not published. If you need to change the page URL after publishing, you need to unpublish the page first. Please note that changing a URL will break all the existing links that pointed to the previous URL.
   - **Description**: the page description is used for accessibility purposes. 

3. Click **Save** to save the entered information.

Please not that changing the title or the description after publishing the page will trigger the Draft status.
It means that you must publish your page to make the changes visible for the visitors.
