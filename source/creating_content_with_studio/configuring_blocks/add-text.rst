The left side pane of the text editor allows you to perform the following actions:

  - Controlling block alignment (right, center, or left)
  - Inserting or removing lists
  - Inserting separators
  - Undoing and redoing actions

    :class: note
 
    When configuring the alignment, you can only use a single option (right, center, or left) for the whole block.
    You cannot define a different text alignment for a heading, a paragraph, or a list within a block.
