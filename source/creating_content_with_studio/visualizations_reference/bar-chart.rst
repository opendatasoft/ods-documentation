Bar charts show data values represented as horizontal bars, meaning that the longer the bar the larger the category.
Categories are generally organized along the vertical axis and data values along the horizontal axis.

Use cases
---------

- City expenditures by department in 2020

Best practices
--------------

- If you are hesitating between using a pie chart or a bar chart, count the number of categories to displayed. If you have more than 5 or 6 categories, a bar chart is more legible.
