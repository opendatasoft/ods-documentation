In column charts, categories are generally organized along the horizontal axis and data values along the vertical axis.
The data is plotted vertically, meaning that the higher the bar the larger the category.

Use cases
---------

- City expenditures by department in 2020

Best practices
--------------

- If you are hesitating between using a pie chart or a column chart, count the number of categories to displayed. If you have more than 5 or 6 categories, a column chart is more legible.
